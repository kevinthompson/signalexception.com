I would recommend Kevin Thompson to anyone for almost anything, because he is a stand-up guy with integrity, a baffling array of skills, a fantastic sense of humor and an unbeatable work ethic. 

I have worked directly with him on a number of projects related to graphic design, programming, user interface/user experience and general web development. His feedback has always been thorough and useful, his work always meets or exceeds expectations and he is incredibly fast and efficient. You can tell that he loves what he does, and that he's been doing it for a long time. 

Aside from being adept at all things web and design, Kevin is great to work with. He is easygoing, funny and a good communicator, and just an all around cool guy.
