title: Red Shirts and Brown Pants

One of the most important things I've learned about leadership, and I suppose
life in general, is to keep calm in the face of danger. When you're presented
with a problem, it rarely does any good to panic.

When I find myself in a particularly intense situation, I try and think through these steps:

- What's the damage?
- Is there still a threat?
- What's the immediate resolution?
- What's the long term solution?

One anecdote (or maybe more of a joke) that typically comes to mind after the
dust settles is this:

>  On one fine sunny day out in the Caribbean, Captain Jack was informed by his
>  lookout that there were 3 Pirate ships spotted about 10 miles out. The Captain
>  turned to his First Mate and said, "Go fetch me my red shirt."
>
>  The Captain then informed the crew that they were going to fight the Pirates and
>  that this would most likely be a bloody battle.
>
>  The crew and the Pirates meet to do battle and the Captain and his crew are
>  victorious with only three dead and fifteen wounded out of his crew of one
>  hundred. As the crew is celebrating with their Captain, the First Mate asks him,
>  "Sir, why did you wear your red shirt for that battle?"
>
>  The Captain responds, "I wore them so that if I were to get injured in battle,
>  no one would notice and would continue fighting." The crew is amazed that their
>  Captain is so noble and make a toast for long life to their Captain.
>
>  The next day, the lookout informs the Captain that he has spotted over fifty
>  Pirate ships about ten miles out. The Captain turns to his First Mate and calmly
>  says, "Go fetch my brown pants."

Fear, stress, and anxiety are all natural in these situations. Don't fret the
feelings; focus on channeling that energy into something productive, and when
all else fails, put on your brown pants.
