##Time for a change

Over the last few weeks, I've pieced together a relatively simple design and configured the barest of [ExpressionEngine](http://expressionengine.com) installations. The site now allows me to post simple blog posts and project entries, and for you, the reader, to navigate them in some capacity. I've set a goal for myself to produce at least one post per week, and at least one substantial post per month.

I hope to avoid posting trivial links, photos, or comments to this blog (but you're welcome to [follow me on twitter](http://twitter.com/kevinthompson) if you're into that sort of thing), and I hope that over time it will serve as a valuable resource my peers and for fledgling designers and developers

I'm excited to finally begin producing content for a community that has fostered my growth as a developer for the past five years, and I hope that you'll enjoy what I have to offer.
