I wrote a post on [Medium](https://medium.com/architecting-a-life/aebd9a8772f0) a few days ago about my thoughts related to my career
and life goals.

>  By the age of thirty, I need to accomplish something grand — sell a company,
>  become a famed speaker, maintain a blog with an involved and active readership.
>  These all seem like attainable goals and good markers of success, but they were
>  ideas formed on popular notions, and not on what makes me personally feel
>  accomplished, or successful.
