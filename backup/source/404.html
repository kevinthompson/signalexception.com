      <p>Looks like I might have misplaced this page. I'll see if I can sort out what went wrong, but in the meantime, you might find what you're looking for on the <a href="/">home page</a> or over at my <a href="/blog/">blog</a>.</p>
  		<p>If all else fails, <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">email me</a> or contact me on <a href="skype:{{site.skype}}?add">Skype</a> and I'll see what I can do.</p>
