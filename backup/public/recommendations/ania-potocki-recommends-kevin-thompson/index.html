<p>I&rsquo;ve just recently began working with Kevin, and he is a breath of fresh air. As a developer he holds all the characteristics you would want / need. He is very knowledgeable, he works quickly, he knows how to communicate, he is a problem solver &ndash; always finding the best solution, he is honest and trustworthy, he meets his deadlines, he is always responsive and has a great personality&hellip; what more could you ask for?</p>
