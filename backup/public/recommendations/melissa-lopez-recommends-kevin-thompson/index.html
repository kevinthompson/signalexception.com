<p>Kevin is a bright man who&rsquo;s able to develop solutions for projects when at times it seems there are none. He is able to take direction and run with it to develop great websites and programming. The one thing I truly appreciate and will always praise Kevin for is his ability to teach others. He&rsquo;s very patient and explains his processes in a way that others understand quickly and easily. Overall he is an asset to any team.</p>
